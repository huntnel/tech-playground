# Code Adventure Tech Playground

## Problem

The technology sector continues to experience a significant representation gap. Code Adventure was founded two years ago to address gender disparities, especially in Utah, where women’s participation in STEM is notably low. While the camp has made strides in improving gender diversity, the broader issue of ethnic underrepresentation remains pronounced. Despite making up a substantial portion of the U.S. population, Hispanics are markedly underrepresented in the STEM workforce. According to Pew Research, Hispanics accounted for only 8% of STEM workers in the U.S., even though they constituted 17% of the total workforce.

## Solution

Our vision is to spark a lifelong interest in coding for boys and girls in underserved communities in technology. Code Adventure isn’t just about learning; it’s about inspiring students to pursue their passions with their peers! This year, our efforts have centered on:

- Expanding our reach to more underserved communities in tech.
- Revitalizing the curriculum to better accomplish our objectives.
- Building a gamified learning experience.
- Creating a community where the kids feel safe and inspired.

In addition to a 3-day summer camp in June to inspire girls to pursue coding, we held a day camp on Saturday, March 23, serving the Hispanic community at Microsoft’s Lehi office. 

While parts of the camp get more technical, the focus is less on teaching technical skills and more on inspiring students to continue pursuing coding. To achieve this goal, we developed a gamified Python learning playground designed to be used in tandem with our lessons, creating an interactive, engaging, and fun learning experience with exciting, take-home growth opportunities. This learning environment, paired with a 1:3 volunteer-to-student ratio, equips participants to leave our camps not just with knowledge, but with stories and creations they’re excited to share with their family and friends.

## Core Components

- **Gamified Python Learning Playground**:
  - An immersive and entertaining environment for participants to practice coding concepts.
  - Designed to support ongoing learning, allowing kids to practice new concepts post-camp.
  - Structured for scalability, facilitating easy integration of new modules for future camps.

- **Curriculum**:
  - Designed to spark a lifelong interest in coding.

- **Expansion into Hispanic Community**:
  - Includes bilingual resources and relevant curriculum.

- **Inspiring Speakers and Volunteers**:
  - Showcase pathways to success in tech.

## Outcomes and Evaluations

The March camp was a marked success. After introducing the tech playground to the students, many chose to continue working on the storyline problems instead of taking snack breaks. At the end of the camp, every respondent marked on an anonymous survey that they enjoyed the camp and felt included. Only one respondent mentioned that the camp didn’t meet their expectations and that they wouldn’t be interested in attending future camps. However, 75% of survey respondents left positive comments about the tech playground.

## MVP Description

- The Python playground is designed to be used on a desktop – it is NOT mobile-friendly.
- It is designed to PRACTICE coding concepts, NOT teach them.

### Integration into Camp

1. A Python/coding concept is taught in an instructor-led curriculum.
2. The first couple of levels of each module are walked through together with the students to practice the concepts they just learned.
3. The last couple of levels of each module are for the students to practice the concepts on their own, with volunteer assistance if needed.

### Module Structure

- The concepts in Module 1 are the easiest, with increasing difficulty through to Module 5.
- The first 3 modules are taught in our camps, with resources sent out post-camp for participants to continue practicing at home with modules 4 and 5.

### Code Validation

- We have checks to validate correct input before marking a level as complete.
- While it’s possible to craft an input that bypasses our checks, the system satisfies our use case and has not caused issues in testing or camps.

### Additional Information

- Each level has a “Show Hint” button that displays the correct code.
- **Note**: Python is indentation-sensitive. Ensure proper indentation, especially if copying and pasting from the hint modal. Make sure everything after the `def TaskNum():` is indented.
- If you receive an "Internal Error," your code is incorrect, possibly due to spacing or an infinite loop.
