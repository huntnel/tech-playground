In order to run the backend, cd into the backend directory and type npm run dev. This will start
the server on port 5000. You can verify that it's working by navigating to localhost:5000/api. You
should see some test data appear on screen. Currently we don't use the backend for anything, but it's there if we ever add a feature that requires a backend.
The backend folder is also where we store our code for the AWS lambda that the code editor runs on.

To run the front end, in a separate terminal (leave the terminal running the backend open) cd into
the frontend directory and type npm start. This will start the react server on port 3000. If you 
navigate to localhost:3000, you will see the frontend server running React.
